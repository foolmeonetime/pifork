imagine a web dapp where you can use your etheruem wallet to partipate in a ecosystem that helps secure the magma blockchain nodes by mining a tin of $beans and watching ads on the app.

its free to particpate just ad revenue focused. in order to mine beans you need an active miner wallet address aka a referral, miners recieve points for referrals you can make tiers of the system with direct and indirect referrals and more (referral of referral) and so on. 

we need a mining rig for miners to use on the website, just needs to track the amount of tokens a miners is owed. Also a miners log for tracking beans and points
