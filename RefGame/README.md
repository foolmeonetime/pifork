# TheReferralGame

## Overview
TheReferralGame is a blockchain-based game that rewards players with points for referring new participants. These points can be converted into BEANS tokens, the game's native digital currency.

## How It Works

### Joining the Game
- **Start**: Join the game by using a referral link or address from an existing player.
- **Referral Chain**: Your participation extends the referral chain, potentially up to 15 levels deep.

### Earning Points
- **Direct Referrals**: Earn points by referring new players directly.
- **Indirect Referrals**: Gain additional points for players brought into the game by your referrals, up to 15 levels deep.

### Withdrawing Points
- **Conversion to BEANS**: Convert your points into BEANS tokens at your discretion.
- **Withdrawal**: Execute a withdrawal to transfer the equivalent BEANS tokens into your wallet.

## Reward Multipliers and Example

### Understanding Reward Multipliers
- The game uses reward multipliers to calculate points for different levels of referrals.
- **Direct Referrals (Level 1)** have the highest multiplier.
- **Multiplier Decrease**: With each subsequent level, the multiplier decreases, reducing the points for indirect referrals.

### Example
- Assume the following multipliers: Level 1 (Direct) = 1x, Level 2 = 0.75x, Level 3 = 0.5x, and so on.
- **Scenario**: You refer Alice (Level 1), who then refers Bob (Level 2), who brings in Carol (Level 3).
- **Your Rewards**:
  - For Alice's referral, you get 100 points (1x multiplier).
  - For Bob's referral (through Alice), you get 75 points (0.75x multiplier).
  - For Carol's referral (through Bob and Alice), you receive 50 points (0.5x multiplier).

## Game Rules
- **Referral Levels**: Points decrease as the referral level increases, incentivizing direct referrals.
- **Token Cap**: The BEANS token minting ceases once the total supply hits 999,999,999,999 tokens.

## Strategy Tips
- **Expand Your Network**: More direct referrals translate to more points.
- **Encourage Your Referrals**: Inspire your network to actively participate and grow their networks to maximize your indirect rewards.
